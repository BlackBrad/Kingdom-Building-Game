# Kingdom-Building-Game
Currently untitled so I'm just rolling with 'kingdom building game' at the moment. 

Currently doesn't do much. Reads data from text files that gets loaded into the game, sets up and draws the game map. 

If you want to run this (even though it does not much at the moment) then you need to place the game_data folder to wherever you place the executable otherwise the data won't be loaded into the game and it might crash (I don't know).
